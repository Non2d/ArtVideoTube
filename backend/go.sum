The go.sum file is automatically generated by Go when you run commands that involve module dependencies, such as `go mod tidy` or `go build`. It contains checksums for the modules used in your project to ensure their integrity.

Since this file is generated and should not be manually edited, I will provide a placeholder indicating that this file is intentionally left blank.
